#Cluster number 5 is high income and high spend - these may be more 'high end' customers and could look to target them accordingly.
#Cluster number 2 is high income but low spend - perhaps they mainly shop at other malls or spend money on activities/items not sold within your mall. Perhaps may want to target with further data collection to find out more about this in case we are able to target with a particular campaign if we find they are shopping at competitors.
